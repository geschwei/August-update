# Module 9 - Lab 8 - Exercise 2 - Manage Public Folders

In the prior exercise, Holly Dickson logged into the Exchange admin center for
Exchange Online on LON-CL1 and created a Microsoft 365 public folder mailbox and
a public folder. In this exercise, she will manage settings and permissions for
each of these objects using the Exchange Online EAC.

## Task 1 - Manage Public Folder Mail Settings

In this task, you will continue in your role as Holly Dickson and enable the
Test PF1 public folder that you created in the prior exercise so that it can
receive email.

1.  You should still be logged into LON-CL1 from the prior lab; if necessary,
    log in as the **Administrator** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.

2.  In the Edge browser, you should still be in the **Exchange admin center**
    from the end of the prior task. Specifically, you should still be on the
    **public folders** page, and you should be in the **public folders** tab.

3.  On the **public folders** page, the **Test PF1** record that you created in
    the prior task should be highlighted.  
    ‎  
    ‎**Important:** If you closed the EAC tab at the end of the prior task and
    had to navigate to this page in the prior step, then select the **Test PF1**
    row. Do not select the **Test PF1** hyperlink as this will open the **Test
    PF1** public folder window. Instead, select any other portion of the **Test
    PF1** row to simply highlight the record.

4.  By selecting the Test PF1 record, the properties for this public folder are
    displayed in the detail pane on the right. Note the current **Mail
    settings** for Test PF1 is set to Disabled. To enable mail for this public
    folder, select **Enable**.

5.  A **Warning** dialog box will appear that asks whether you want to enable
    email for the selected public folders. Select **Yes**.

6.  In the detail pane on the right, the **Mail settings** should now be
    **Enabled.**

7.  Leave all browser tabs open and proceed to the next task.

## Task 2 - Manage Public Folder Settings

In this task, you will manage several settings for the Test PF1 public folder.

1.  You should still be in LON-CL1 and you should be in the **Exchange admin
    center** tab in your browser.

2.  In the **Exchange admin center**, you should still be in the **public
    folders** page after having completed the prior task.

3.  On the **public folders** page, the **Test PF1** record that you updated in
    the prior task should be highlighted.  
    ‎  
    ‎**Important:** If you closed the EAC tab at the end of the prior task and
    had to navigate to this page in the prior step, then select the **Test PF1**
    row. Do not select the **Test PF1** hyperlink as this will open the **Test
    PF1** public folder window. Instead, select any other portion of the **Test
    PF1** row to simply highlight the record.

4.  With the **Test PF1** record highlighted in the public folder list, select
    the **pencil (Edit)** icon in the menu bar to edit the record. This opens
    the **Test PF1** properties window.

5.  In the **Test PF1** properties window, the **general** tab in the left-hand
    navigation pane is displayed by default. Review the fields in this tab and
    note the value in the **Public folder mailbox** field; this indicates that
    **Test PF1** was automatically assigned to the **Test PF mailbox1** that you
    created in the first task in this exercise.

6.  In the **Test PF1** properties window, in the left-hand navigation pane,
    select the **general mail properties** tab.

7.  Change the value of the **Display Name** field to **First public folder.**

8.  Select the **Hide from Exchange address list** checkbox.  
      
    **Note:** By selecting this check box, the public folder will not appear in
    Adatum’s address book and other address lists, but it will still receive
    email.

9.  In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **mail flow settings** tab.

10. Under the **Display Name** field, select the **Require that all senders are
    authenticated** check box.

11. Select **Save**. Once the settings have been saved, select **Close**.

12. Leave all browser tabs open and proceed to the next task.

## Task 3 - Manage Public Folder Permissions

In this task, you will manage the permissions for the Test PF1 public folder.

1.  You should still be in LON-CL1 and you should be in the **Exchange admin
    center** tab in your browser.

2.  In the **Exchange admin center**, you should still be in the **public
    folders** page,after having completed the prior task.

3.  On the **public folders** page, the **Test PF1** record that you updated in
    the prior task should be highlighted.

4.  With the **Test PF1** record highlighted in the public folder list, a **Test
    PF1** detail pane will be displayed on the right side of the screen. In the
    detail pane, under **Folder permissions**, select **Manage**.

5.  A **Test PF1** window will appear that enables you to add or remove users
    who can access this public folder and edit its permissions. Select the
    **plus (+) sign** icon to add users.

6.  In the **public folder permissions** window, select the **Browse** button to
    the right of the **User** field, select **Holly Dickson,** and then select
    **OK**.
